//replaced the following line (resolve commit)
some initial content
//resolved the conflict by introducing this line here
lets reactivate mr anoterh-branch-of-master and create some more conflicts!! (I also corrected the line before)
this is content written when branch-from-master is active
second commit from branch of master . I can modify this during the commit process
this is a modification on branch-from-master after having it merged to master already
//I resolved the problem by keeping this line
this is form master. lets create a conflict
//and keeping the following line
this is from branch-from-master and is written in the same line as the commit from master (it should create a conflict)
//this is considered a new commit?
