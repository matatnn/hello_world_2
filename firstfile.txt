some intitial content
this is content written when branch-from-master is active
second commit from branch of master . I can modify this during the commit process
this is a modification on branch-from-master after having it merged to master already
//I resolved the problem by keeping this line
this is form master. lets create a conflict
//and keeping the following line
this is from branch-from-master and is written in the same line as the commit from master (it should create a conflict)
//this is considered a new commit?
